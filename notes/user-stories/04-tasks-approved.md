# Team approves tasks

Ask tasks are submitted the team is requested to submit their votes on whether they approve or reject the task in its current form. Of course feedback could be built into the system, but here we will rely on each to explain why they rejected a task off-chain, thereby providing feedback to the task proposer for a future revised submission. But most tasks are approved without a revision necessary by garnering 3 yeses, thereby triggering disbursement of budgetary funds to the task owner's wallet address.

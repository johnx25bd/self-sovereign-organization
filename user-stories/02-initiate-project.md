# Core team initiates project

Now that the terms are defined and the project contracts are written and deployed on the blockchain, each of the participants need to submit 300 DAI from their whitelisted wallet addresses.

Once the contract has received 1500 DAI, 300 from each of the participating addresses, the project is initiated and tasks can be submitted.

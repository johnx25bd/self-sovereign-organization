# Self sovereign organization: research paper outline

## Introduction

Problem statement
Current / historic solutions
Why blockchain may offer opportunity for innovation

Unique value proposition: we want to understand how organizations can be governed by smart contracts at smaller scales. We see these as being towards the ends of the branches of the "fractal federal organizations" described in the DAOstack white paper, eventually composing the constituent parts of the complex DAO mesh network they envision. Understanding the behavior of smaller agencies, and ones where constituent members (i.e. human agents) know and, to some extent, trust each other, could provide a basis for modeling the emergent behavior of DAO networks at scale.

Our project is not intended to scale, and it is not decentralized in as much as it is designed for people coordinated off-chain.

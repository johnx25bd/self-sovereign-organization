# Research paper

DAOs and their potential role
- Aggregate and disburse funds
- Collective decision making
- Mesh networks of organizations

Ricardian contracts
- Ensuring DAO compliance within legal jurisdiction
- Potential for auto-generation of legal contracts, auditing / accounting documents, registration papers etc

Privacy on a public blockchain
- IPFS
- Fully homomorphic encryption and proxy re-encryption
